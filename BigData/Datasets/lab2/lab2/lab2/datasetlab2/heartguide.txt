Heart Disease Prediction Model
Features:

age - Age: The age of the individual in years.

sex - Sex: The gender of the individual (1 = male, 0 = female).

CP - Chest Pain Type: Indicates the type of chest pain experienced:
    0: Typical angina (chest pain related to the heart)
    1: Atypical angina
    2: Non-anginal pain
    3: Asymptomatic

trestbps - Resting Blood Pressure: The individualâ€™s blood pressure (mmHg) measured during rest.

chol - Serum Cholesterol: Cholesterol level in mg/dL.

fbs - Fasting Blood Sugar: Indicates whether fasting blood sugar is above 120 mg/dL (1 = true, 0 = false).

restecg - Resting Electrocardiographic Results: Results from a resting electrocardiogram:
    0: Normal
    1: ST-T wave abnormality
    2: Possible or definite left ventricular hypertrophy

thalach - Max Heart Rate Achieved: The maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.

exang - Exercise-Induced Angina: Whether or not the individual experiences angina (chest pain) due to exercise (1 = yes, 0 = no).

oldpeak - ST Depression: The amount of ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, a measure of heart stress.

slope - Slope of ST Segment: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment:
    0: Upsloping
    1: Flat
    2: Downsloping

ca - Number of Major Vessels: The number of major blood vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.

thal - Thalassemia: A blood disorder:
    0 = normal
    1 = fixed defect
    2 = reversible defect

target - Heart Disease:
    0: indicates its absence.
    1: indicates the presence of heart disease
