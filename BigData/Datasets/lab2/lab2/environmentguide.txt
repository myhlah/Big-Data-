Climate Prediction Model
Features:

temp - Temperature (°C): The ambient air temperature, ranging from 0°C to 50°C.    
                  Higher temperatures might indicate warmer or hot conditions.

hum - Humidity (%): The amount of moisture in the air, ranging from 1% to 100%.
            High humidity values indicate more moisture, making conditions feel warmer or muggy.

wind - Wind Speed: The speed of wind, ranging from 0 to 20 (units could be km/h or mph).
            Higher values indicate stronger winds.

pres - Pressure (%): Atmospheric pressure, ranging from 1% to 100%.
              Lower pressure values often signal stormy weather.

heat - Heat Index (°C): The "feels like" temperature considering both temperature and humidity, ranging from 0°C to 70°C.
                 High heat index indicates discomfort due to high temperature and humidity.

dew - Dew Point (%): The temperature at which air becomes saturated and moisture condenses, ranging from 1% to 100%.
               A higher dew point typically indicates more humid conditions.

chill - Wind Chill Index: A measure of how cold it feels when wind is taken into account, ranging from 0 to 100.
                  Higher wind chill values indicate colder perceived temperatures.

temphum - Comfort Level: A qualitative measure of how comfortable the climate is:
    0: Normal
    1: Fair
    2: Uncomfortable
    3: Hot
    4: Cold

humwind - Air Level: Describe the wind's force:
    0: Calm
    1: Breezy
    2: Windy
    3: Strong Wind
    4: Gale

events - Weather Events (Target): Indicates whether a weather event occured.
    0: Indicates no weather event occurred.
    1: Indicates that a significant weather event occurred.
